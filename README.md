## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Go to its root folder.

3. Create a virtual environment with:

    `python3 -m venv venv`

4. Activate the virtual environment with:

    `source venv/bin/activate`

5. Install required dependencies with:

    `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

6. Add a .env file with `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY`:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=<your_local_database_address>
    SECRET_KEY=<a_random_string_to_enable_app_sessions_properly>
    ```

    The `DATABASE_URL` depends on your system and PostgreSQL setup.

    The `SECRET_KEY` can be generated with, for example:

    ```
    $ python3
    >>> import secrets
    >>> secrets.token_hex(16)
    ```

7. Set your database to use the required schema with: 
    `psql database_name < schema.sql`

8. Run the app with:

    `flask run`
